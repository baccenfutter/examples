// Service updown exposes both a upload and download methods.

// This example demonstrates how to implement upload and download of big files
// in
// Goa without having to load the entire content in memory first.

// The upload method uses SkipRequestBodyEncodeDecode to delegate reading the
// HTTP
// request body to the service logic. This alleviates the need for loading the
// full body content in memory first to decode it into a data structure. Note
// that
// using SkipRequestBodyDecode is incompatible with gRPC and can only be used on
// methods that only define a HTTP transport mapping. This example
// implementation
// leverages package "mime/multipart" to read the request body.

// Similarly the download method uses SkipResponseBodyEncodeDecode to stream the
// file to the client without requiring to load the complete content in memory
// first. As with SkipRequestBodyDecode using SkipResponseBodyEncodeDecode is
// incompatible with gRPC.
